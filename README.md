## Declare :
Our program will give institutions like universities and businesses the ability to track their students or employees with a virtual profile on a website that contains a qr code on the user's phone.It will be able to relay information such as: name, gender, time entered, etc. to a database after being scanned by a camera located near the door. This will allow the institutions to be able to perform various functions like attendance sheet, tardiness, etc.
